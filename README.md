# Aperture Tracking Blender Importer

This Blender add-on can import the tracking data created by the Minecraft mod Aperture. It imports for example camera tracking, morph tracking and entity tracking.

# How to install
Download this as zip, then in Blender's add-ons panel (File > User Preferences > Add-ons), click "Install from File"... and finally choose the downloaded zip. That should install this script.

# How to use
After exporting the tracking data from the Aperture Mod you go into Blender Menu - File > Import > Import Aperture JSON then you select the json file.

The addon now supports multiple file import. The files will be imported by sorting them alphabetically.
